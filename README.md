GEOLOGY 1104 Geology for Engineers I 
Part A: 6 shorter answer questions (5 marks each)
1. On the blank   plot below, draw   P wave and S wave velocity   vs   depth   for   Earth,   in which   the   outer   core   is solid rather than liquid. Assume the composition of the outer core   and   inner   core   are   the   same.





2. The graph to the right   illustrates how the temperature changed with time for part of the rock   cycle.   In   just   one or two sentences maximum, explain the events illustrated   by this   temperature time plot. 

3. Briefly explain how the internal   structure   of the silicate   minerals   biotite   and quartz   determines   the   presence or absence of cleavage   in those minerals.
4.   Venn   Diagram: Convergent Plate   Boundaries.    Use the Venn diagram, below, to compare   and contrast the similarities and differences between the three styles   of convergent plate   boundaries. Write   features unique to each group in the   larger areas   of the circles;   note features   that the   different boundaries share in the overlapping areas of the circles.   Place the   numbers   corresponding to the   list   of   characteristics below in the most suitable   locations on   the   diagram. 
1.         Present on   Earth
2.         Formed from magma
3.          Form. exclusively at or near the surface
4.         May form. from the mantle
5.         Example: Gneiss
6.         Classification of this/these rock type(s) considers texture
7.         Form. beds and   bedding
8.         Can be deposited in   running water
9.         Example: granite
10.   May undergo weathering at Earth’s surface to form. sediment
11.   Form. as a result of crystallization
12.   Solidify under conditions of decreasing heat
13.   Classification of   this/these rock type(s) considers composition
14.   Maybe intrusive
15.   Can display a fabric, or foliation

5. Column   1 provides you with the names of four different geologic features.   In   columns 2   and   3,   circle   all the answers that apply to that feature.Column 1 Column 2 Column 3 Name of Feature Type of Plate Boundary or Other Feature (circle just one best answer) Likely Cause(s) of Melting (circle all that may apply) rift valley (a) continental rift (b) ocean-continent convergent (c) continental collision (d) hotspot in a continent (a) decompression melting as the mantle rises (b) melting by adding water along a subduction zone (c) melting of continental crust caused by an influx of mantle-derived magma Mid-ocean ridge (a) oceanic divergent (b) ocean-ocean convergent (c) ocean-continent convergent (d) hotspot in an ocean (a) decompression melting as the mantle rises (b) melting by adding water along a subduction zone (c) melting of continental crust caused by an influx of mantle-derived magma Continental magmatic arc (a) continental rift (b) ocean-continent convergent (c) continental collision (d) hotspot in a continent (a) decompression melting as the mantle rises (b) melting by adding water along a subduction zone (c) melting of continental crust caused by an influx of mantle-derived magma Island arc (a) oceanic divergent (b) ocean-ocean convergent (c) ocean-continent convergent (d) hotspot in an ocean (a) decompression melting as the mantle rises (b) melting by adding water along a subduction zone (c) melting of continental crust caused by an influx of mantle-de代 写GEOLOGY 1104 Geology for Engineers IR

6. What happens during   lithification, and how   does   lithification   differ from   metamorphism?
Part B.   Answer TWO of the following THREE longer answer questions in the pages   provided.   Where possible, drawings are encouraged.   10 marks each.
1. The crust/mantle boundary is very different from the   lithosphere/asthenosphere   boundary. Answer   the following three parts for each of these two boundaries. Plan   on   about   1-1.5   pages   for your final         answer. Dot point answers are fine. Sketches encouraged.
A)   Does the composition or rock type vary across each of the two   boundaries?   Explain your   answer.
B)   Do physical properties vary across each of the two   boundaries?   Explain your answer.
C)   Do either of the two boundaries have anything to do with   plate   movement?   If yes, what?
2. Question about the generation of magma in the   mantle.   Fill   in the   short   answers   in   column   two   for         each question.    Numbers are provided to   indicate   how many   answers   for   each   question   part   a   through   e.   All answers are togo in the boxes   provided.   Note that this   question   continues   on the   next   page.Column 1: questions Column 2: answers a. Three reasons why mantle rock ever (partially) melts? (just a few sentences for each) 1. 2. 
3. Column 1: questions Column 2: answers b. What type of rock melts in the mantle (felsic, mafic or ultramafic) c. What type of magma is formed from that event? d. What igneous rocks (by specific name) are formed when that magma cools? 1. 2. 
e. What are three typical minerals in these types of rocks from part d? 1. 2. 3. 
Question 3. All answers for this question are done on this   page or   on   the   map,   following   page.
Winter is coming.    Stannis   Baratheon recognises that a   shortage of obsidian   puts Westeros   at great   risk   from the Others.   In the quest for further resources, he   has sent   his   men   to   gather   earthquake   data   and      bathymetric surveys of the oceans, and also plotted a number   of volcanic   islands   in their search for obsidian (dragonstone).
The map next page is the   result of their efforts. The   grey   labelled   areas   are   continental   masses.   The   white is ocean. The solid black lines   are   plate   boundaries   of some type.   The   small   land   bits   in   the southwest corner of the map, on the   Dorne   Plate, are volcanic islands with ages   labelled.
Your   tasks areas follows:
a) On the map, some plate   boundaries   (the solid   lines)   have   been   labelled A-D.   In   the   spaces   below,         name each plate boundary type.    Be specific   about the   types   of plates   involved.   For   example,   don’t   just   write   ‘subduction zone’; but ‘ocean plate-ocean plate subduction   zone.
A
B
C
D  
b) Of the four boundaries labelled A, B, Cand   D, at which   boundary(ies)would you expect to   find   volcanic activity?
c)   If   you thought any of the labelled boundaries A, B, C   or   D   was   a   subduction   zone   boundary,   indicate   on the map on which side you would expect to find volcanoes. Mark the   letter Von that   side.
d)   Based on the age of the volcanic islands in the southwestern corner, draw   anarrow   on   the   map   that   indicates the direction of movement of the   Dorne   Plate.
